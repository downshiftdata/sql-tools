## deploy folder

See the README.md in that folder.

## gen folder

The scripts in this folder are for automatically generating scripts for CRUD procedures for tables in a new database. They are not meant to be comprehensive. They are only a starting point for subsequent manual editing.

*It will be a cold day in hell before they support heaps.*

## get folder

The scripts in this folder are for automatically generting scripts for existing objects in a legacy database. The goal here is to close any gaps in repo coverage of the existing database.
